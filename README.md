### Project Structure

There are 2 independent versions of docs currently in the project (v5 and v6)
`www.getpostman/docs` is redirected to `www.getpostman/docs/v6/`

*To update v6 (same procedure to update v5):*

* Landing page reference links is maintained at `/_data/v6_map.json`

* Posts are maintained under `/v6`

* The folder structure of /v6 is the URL strucure for posts. For example, `/v6/Do_what_ever/As_long_as/It_is_fun.md` is mapped to URL `www.getpostman/docs/v6/Do_what_ever/As_long_as/It_is_fun`

* Popular Topics is maintained at `/_includes/_popular_topics.html`

* Version selector is maintained at `/_includes/_version_selector.html`

* Docs specific styling is maintained at `/_includes/_meta.html` (we currently hide the version selector via css, when the time comes, change the css in this main.scss file to display the version selector.)

This project does not have any hacky implementatoins, follows strictly the standard way of implementing pages and it is documented in [Jekyll's docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
