Postman Monitors can be used to track functionality and end-to-end performance of your APIs and response time. You can also view New Relic metrics for your API, and see relevant New Relic dashboards and deployments within Postman.

* [Using monitors](#using-monitors)
* [Viewing New Relic APM metrics](#viewing-new-relic-apm-metrics)

## Using monitors

You can link monitors in your current workspace to an API version. This enables you to check an API's performance and response times at scheduled intervals. From an API version's **Monitoring** tab, you can [create a new monitor](#creating-a-new-monitor) or [add an existing monitor](#adding-an-existing-monitor).

### Creating a new monitor

In the API version **Monitoring** tab, next to **Monitors**, select __Add Monitor__ and choose **Create new monitor**.

You can choose between generating a collection from your API schema, using an existing collection, or creating a new collection:

* **Generate a collection from a schema:**
    1. Specify a name for the collection.
    1. Configure how the collection will be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**.
    1. Select **Generate collection and continue**.
* **Use an existing collection:**
    1. Choose an existing collection in the dropdown list.
    1. Select **Select Collection and Continue**.
* **Create a new collection:**
    1. Add the requests you plan to monitor, specifying the method and URL, as well as the status code and response time you want to check.
    1. Click **Create Collection and Continue**.

Next, configure the new monitor. For details, see [Setting up a monitor](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).

### Adding an existing monitor

You can add an existing monitor to your API:

1. In the API version **Monitoring** tab, next to **Monitors**, select __Add Monitor__ and choose **Add existing monitor**.

1. Select a monitor from the list and click **Add Monitor**. You will only see available monitors in your workspace in the list.

For more about creating a monitor, see [Setting up a monitor](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).

## Viewing New Relic APM metrics

New Relic is an application performance management (APM) solution to monitor real-time and trending data for your processes or web apps. The API Builder has a New Relic integration that enables you to access New Relic APM metrics from directly within Postman.

With this integration, each version of your API in Postman can be linked to multiple services from New Relic. Each service can correspond to a running instance of the API, such as beta, prod1, and prod2. You can also optionally link multiple dashboards from New Relic to your API.

### Connecting to New Relic

Before beginning, you must set up APM services for each deployment of your API. See [the New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/) for more details.

To connect an API to New Relic:

1. Open an API version and select the **Monitoring** tab.
1. Under **Connect to APM**, select **New Relic**.
1. On the **Authenticate** tab:
    1. Enter a nickname.
    1. Enter a New Relic User API Key. For more information, see the [New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).
    1. Select your New Relic region.
    1. Select **Authenticate**.
1. On the **Select Services** tab:
    1. Select one or more of your New Relic APM services.
    1. Optionally, select one or more of your New Relic Dashboards.
    1. Select **Connect**.

### Using the APM dashboard

Once your New Relic connection is established, the **Monitoring** tab will show a table of your services, along with their latency, error rate, apdex (ratio of successful to total requests), and health status.

You can also select **Dashboard Quicklinks** to choose a link to any of your configured New Relic dashboards. The links will open the dashboard page in New Relic in a new browser window.

Select the name of a service to open a new tab in Postman containing an APM dashboard. The dashboard is continually updated with:

* Graphs for web transaction time, throughput, error rate, and apdex score. Select a point on a graph to show an exact value for that time.
* Tables of violation Events, slowest transactions by time, and deployments.
* Status if the service is still healthy.

At the top of the dashboard tab, you can:

* Choose another service to view.
* Select **View on New Relic** to open the APM summary in New Relic in a new browser window.
* Choose a time range for the metrics shown.
* Refresh the data in the tab.

To reconfigure the connection to New Relic, select <img alt="Three dots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> and choose **Edit integration**. You can then change the nickname, API key, services, dashboads or region. You can also choose **Delete integration** to remove the connection.
