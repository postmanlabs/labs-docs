You can use Postman monitors to observe the performance and availability of your APIs. <!-- After you link a collection-based monitor, you can view monitor results in the API Builder. -->

Monitor integrations enable you to send the results of collection-based monitors to Slack, Splunk, and other channels. You can also view application performance management (APM) metrics from New Relic or Datadog within Postman.

## Linking collection-based monitors

You can link [collection-based monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/) in your current workspace to an API. This enables you to check an API's performance and response times at scheduled intervals. When linking a monitor, you can [create a new monitor](#creating-a-new-monitor) or [add an existing monitor](#adding-an-existing-monitor).

### Creating a new monitor

To add a new monitor to your API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Under **Power up your API**, select **API Performance**.
1. Next to **Collection-based Monitors**, select **Add Monitor** and choose **Create new monitor**.

You can choose between generating a collection from your API schema, using an existing collection, or creating a new collection:

* **Generate a collection from a schema.**
    1. Specify a name for the collection.
    1. Configure how the collection will be generated by selecting **Show advanced settings**.
    1. Select **Generate collection and continue**.
* **Use an existing collection.**
    1. Choose an existing collection in the dropdown list.
    1. Select **Select Collection and Continue**.
* **Create a new collection.**
    1. Add the requests you plan to monitor, specifying the method and URL, along with the status code and response time you want to check.
    1. Select **Create Collection and Continue**.

Next, configure the new monitor. For details, see [Configuring a collection-based monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#configuring-a-collection-based-monitor).

### Adding an existing monitor

To add an existing monitor to your API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Under **Power up your API**, select **API Performance**.
1. Next to **Collection-based Monitors**, select **Add Monitor** and choose **Add existing monitor**.
1. Select a collection-based monitor from the list and select **Add Monitor**. (The list shows monitors available in your current workspace.)

For more about creating a monitor, see [Setting up a collection-based monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).

## Connecting to monitor integrations

Postman integrations enable you to send the results of collection-based monitors to a variety of applications and channels, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Datadog, or Splunk. You can also send monitor results to a custom webhook to integrate Postman monitors with your specific workflow.

<!-- The **Monitoring** view in the API Builder provides one place to manage all your API's integrations for collection-based monitors. You can set up a new integration, track results, and view your configured monitor integrations. -->

### Adding a monitor integration

Connect Postman to one or more monitoring integrations to send collection-based monitor results to other applications that are part of your API development workflow. <!-- When you add a monitor integration, the monitor is automatically [linked to the API](#linking-monitors). -->

1. If you haven't done so already, [create the collection-based monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) you want to use for monitoring.
1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Under **Power up your API**, select **API Performance**.
1. Under **Connect Postman to your monitoring workflows**, select a monitor integration.
1. Enter a **Nickname** for the integration and choose a monitor. Postman will send the results of this monitor to the application you're integrating with.
1. Finish entering the requested information. This information varies depending on the application you're integrating with, and typically includes an API key. For more help with a specific application, see [Integrating with Postman](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/) and select [Available integrations](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/apimatic/) in the left navigation pane.
1. Select **Add integration**.

> You can configure multiple integrations for a collection-based monitor, or even have more than one instance of the same integration. For example, you can configure two Slack integrations for a monitor that send the monitor's results to two different Slack channels.

<!--
### Working with monitor integrations

Once you've added a monitor integration to an API, you can take the following actions on the **Monitoring** view:

* Select a monitor's name to open its dashboard in a new tab.
* Select **Validate** next to a monitor to validate it against the API schema (OpenAPI 3.0 schemas). If validation isn't successful, select **Issues found** and then select **Review issues**. Learn more about [validating APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/validating-elements-against-schema/).
* Hover over a bar in the graph to view metrics for a monitor run.

* Hover over the application icon for an integration to view details. Select the **Edit** icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> to edit the integration, or select the **Delete** icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> to delete the integration.

  <img alt="Edit an API monitor" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/observe-api-integrations-modify-v9-10.jpg" width="332px">

* Hover over a monitor and select **Run** to immediately run the monitor.
* Hover over a monitor and select the remove icon <img alt="Remove icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-remove-api-element-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> to remove the monitor from the API. (The monitor and its associated integrations aren't deleted.)

## Viewing APM metrics

Application performance management (APM) tools enable you to monitor the health and performance of your APIs. You can observe key metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates.

Postman integrates with popular APM tools so you can view API performance metrics in the same place where you define and test your API. To learn more, see the instructions for your APM tool:

* [New Relic APM](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/observing-an-api/new-relic-apm/)
* [Datadog APM](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/observing-an-api/datadog-apm/)
