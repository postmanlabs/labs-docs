You can share the run results for a collection, by [exporting them from the Collection Runner](#exporting-collection-runs) so that other people can [import them into Postman](#importing-a-run).

## Exporting collection runs

To export a collection run, click __Runner__ and find the run you want to export in the __Recent Runs__ list. You will see the __Export run__ icon appear on hover—click it to download the run.

Choose a location to save your downloaded collection run.

You also can select a collection run from the __Recent Runs__ list and download it from there by clicking **Export Results** at the top.

To export multiple collection run results from the __Recent Runs__ list, hold down the command or control key and select the items from the list that you want to export. Click the __Download__ icon in the menu bar at the top.

## Importing a run

To import a collection run, open the __Runner__ and click **Import Runs** at the top. Navigate your local file directory and import either a JSON collection run file or a .zip file containing multiple collection run results.
