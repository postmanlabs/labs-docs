API publishers require public API documentation and require easy-to-read examples and specifications. Postman publishes [our own API documentation](http://docs.api.getpostman.com) using Postman's documentation. Developers rely on this documentation for learning about the service, implementing their integrations, and debugging. Learn [how to publish your own public docs](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-public-docs/).

[![postman API docs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/59189909.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/59189909.png)  

Postman automatically generates documentation for any of your collections. Publish public API documentation that is:

## **Complete**

Your collections are documented with folders, [requests](/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/requests/), [responses](/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/responses/), [parameters](/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/requests/#url), [code snippets](/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/generate-code-snippets/), [environments](/docs/postman/environments-and-globals/manage-environments/), and [examples](/docs/postman/collections/examples/#what-is-an-example).

## **Customizable**

Create clear and elegant documentation [using Markdown](/docs/postman/api-documentation/how-to-document-using-markdown/) in your descriptions for collections, folders, and requests. Publish this documentation on your [custom domain](/docs/postman/api-documentation/adding-and-verifying-custom-domains/), and further customize the appearance of these pages according to your own brand guidelines.

## **Easy**

Publish your API documentation with the click of a button. The pages are automatically generated, and updates are automatically synced. You will never have to host or manage servers for your API documentation ever again.
