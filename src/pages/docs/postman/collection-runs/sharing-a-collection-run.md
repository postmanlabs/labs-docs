To share a Collection, you can export a collection run to recipients who can import it in their Postman app.

This topic describes how to [export](#exporting-a-run) and [import](#importing-a-run) a collection run.

## Exporting a run

To export a collection run, click the download icon that appears when you hover over a run.

You can then save the generated JSON file wherever you want.

You also can select a collection run and click the **Export Results** button in the Runner's header. Then save the generated JSON file wherever you want.

## Importing a run

To import a run, click the orange **Import Test Run** button on the Runner's selection screen. This action opens an explorer you can use to navigate and import a JSON collection run.
