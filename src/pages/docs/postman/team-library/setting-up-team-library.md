 **NOTE**: **Team Library is only available for versions 5.0 and below.**

Postman Pro and Enterprise users can use the Team Library to enhance collaboration among teammates. This feature enhances collaboration among teammates in several ways.

* **Share collections**
  
  You can [share collections](/docs/postman/team-library/sharing/#sharing-collections) with your team. Collections contain groups of API requests you can organize, add descriptions, attach test scripts, and build conditional workflows.
* **Share environments**
  
  Teams can use [environments](/docs/postman/api-documentation/environments-and-environment-templates/) to create and [share a snapshot of a local environment](/docs/postman/team-library/sharing/#sharing-environments). Users might have different environment variable values, so updates to these values are not synced between shared environments.
* **See the activity feed in the Team Library**
  
  You can see changes to shared collections in the [activity feed](/docs/postman/workspaces/activity-feed-and-restoring-collections/).
* **Subscribe to shared collections**
  
  When you [subscribe to a collection](/docs/postman/team-library/sharing/), you get a synced copy of this collection in your Postman app. If you have edit permissions for the collection, you can make changes that other subscribers to the collection can see.

## Setting up the Team Library
