When running a collection, you can branch and loop across API requests in Postman using the `postman.setNextRequest("request_name");` function.

[![set next request method](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Test_script10.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Test_script10.png)

### Set the request to be executed next

```js
postman.setNextRequest("request_name");
```

### Loop over the current request

Providing the name of current run to `setNextRequest` leads to Postman running the current request continuously.

[![looping current request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/branching_and_looping/branching_and_looping.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/branching_and_looping/branching_and_looping.png)

**Note:** While looping over one request continuously, one should wrap `setNextRequest` in some logic so as to ensure that the request does not run indefinitely otherwise the collection runner would need to be force closed.

### Stop workflow execution

```js
postman.setNextRequest(null);
```

Some salient points about `postman.setNextRequest()`:

1. Specify the name or ID of the subsequent request and the collection runner will take care of the rest.
1. It can be used in the pre-request or the test script. If there's more than one assignment, the last set value takes precedence.
1. If `postman.setNextRequest()` is absent in a request, the collection runner defaults to linear execution and moves to the next request

For more information about control flow, refer to [building workflows](/docs/postman/collection-runs/building-workflows/).
