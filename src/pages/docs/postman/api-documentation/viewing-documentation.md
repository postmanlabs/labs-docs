You can view and comment on private documentation shared with you. Documentation for each collection is published privately by default—you can make documentation visible within a team workspace by sharing the collection. You can optionally choose to publish documentation, in which case anyone with the link can view it.

> If you have edit access to a collection, you can edit its documentation while viewing it in the web browser.

## Viewing private documentation

You can [view documentation for any collection that has been shared with you](/docs/postman/api-documentation/documenting-your-api). You must be logged in to your Postman account to view private documentation.

> Postman Team, Business, and Enterprise teammates with view permissions can comment on documentation, while teammates with edit permissions can write, revise, and update it.

To view documentation for a collection you have access to in the Postman app, select the collection, click the arrow (&#9654;), and choose __View in web__. The collection documentation will open in your web browser.

![View Docs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/view-docs.jpg)

By default you will see detail on each request, including sample code in various client languages, and an indicator of the method, URL, description, headers, request and response structures, examples, and any shared environments. Documentation authors can optionally include other details.

![Public Documentation](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-published.jpg)

> The private URL is only accessible to Postman users logged in with appropriate permissions. To make documentation viewable publicly, you can [publish it](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-your-docs/).

You can alternatively access documentation by selecting the __Browse__ view in the app or opening the web dashboard, choosing __Collections__, and clicking a collection.

![Browse Collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/browse-collection.jpg)

If the documentation you are viewing has multiple versions published, you can select a specific version to view.

You can also choose between any environments included with the documentation you are viewing, and can switch between double and single column layout.

### Commenting on documentation

You can view and post comments on your API documentation to collaborate with teammates. When you view the documentation for a collection, you will see any existing comments on it.

![Documentation Comment](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-comment.jpg)

You can add a comment to join in the discussion. Comments on documentation reflect [comments on the corresponding collection](/docs/postman/collections/commenting-on-collections/).

> You can only comment on private documentation.

## Viewing public documentation

You can access [public documentation](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-your-docs/) through a URL in your web browser. Postman generates the URL when the documentation is published—the URL is also accessible from the [web dashboard](https://web.postman.co/).
