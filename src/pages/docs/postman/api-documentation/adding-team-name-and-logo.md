Postman users with the **Admin** member role can add a team name and logo to their Postman team account directly in the [Team Settings page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).

## Update your team name

To see your current team name, go to the [Team page](https://go.postman.co/team) in the Postman website.

[![team name](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/WS-docs-team2-1.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/WS-docs-team2-1.png)

If you didn’t enter a team name when you first created your Postman Pro or Enterprise team, you can add it in the [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) page.

## Update your team logo

To update your logo, go to the [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) page.

Next hover over the logo under "Team Logo" in the "Style" section to see the **Pencil** (edit) and **Trash Can** (delete) icons.

Now click the **Pencil** icon and upload or drag or drop an image. Then click the **Upload** button to complete the process.

This uploaded image displays in the header of your team's [published documentation](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-public-docs/)  replacing the Postman logo. It may take up to 5 minutes for the logo to update.

## Delete your team logo

To delete a logo, click the **Trash Can** logo.
