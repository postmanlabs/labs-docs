> __[Static IP address monitoring is available on Postman Business and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)__

Postman Monitors access APIs from dynamic IP addresses and does not provide the option to use static IP addresses by default. For users who want to test APIs behind a whitelist restricted firewall you must request this from the [support team](http://www.postman.com/get-started-postman-plans).

By whitelisting a single static IP address, customers can monitor their APIs using Postman’s monitoring service, while conforming to company security policies.

Note that monitoring APIs using a static IP address is available for all Postman Business and Enterprise customers. However, the static IP is a US address.

When the static IP option is enabled, users can create a new monitor or change an existing monitor to run using a static IP address.

## Creating a new monitor to run from a static IP address

In the Postman app, click the "Build" dropdown menu and select "Browse".

Choose the collection you want to monitor, click the ellipsis **(...)** icon, and select "Monitor Collection".

In the **MONITOR COLLECTION** modal, [enter the name and select the environment of the monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting-up-monitor/).
