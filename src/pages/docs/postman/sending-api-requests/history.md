Postman stores all requests you send in the "History" view in the left sidebar. You can also choose to save the responses you get when you send your requests. You can use history to experiment with variations of requests quickly without wasting time building a request from scratch. You can also load a previous request by clicking on the request name.

If you create an account and sign in to Postman, your history will be synced with our server, backed up in real-time, and retrievable across your devices.

**Note:** If you'd like to save responses to your requests in the history, you must turn on the setting 'Save Responses' under the History tab in the left sidebar, as illustrated in the screen below.

## Sidebar History tab

### Navigate through requests

Click on a request in this tab to load the exact request configuration in the builder. You can use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the requests. Postman will load the request in a preview state. Pressing **Enter** will ensure that the request is not replaced by another one.

### Find requests

The requests are ordered by time, with the most recent requests displayed at the top. If your request history becomes large, filter requests in the sidebar using the search input field. Postman matches the request URL in your history with the search term.

### Multi-selecting requests

Hold down the **CMD** key (or **CTRL** on Windows), and click on each request that you want to select. You can initiate actions like [saving](/docs/postman/collections/creating-collections/), [sharing](/docs/postman/collections/sharing-collections/), [documenting](/docs/postman/api-documentation/intro-to-api-documentation), [mocking](/docs/postman/mock-servers/intro-to-mock-servers/), [monitoring](/docs/postman/monitors/intro-monitors/), or deleting on these requests through actions at the top of the list.

### Save requests to a collection

To organize commonly used requests, you can save them from your history to a collection. To save a single request to a collection, hover over it and click the plus icon (**+**) that displays next to it.

When selecting multiple requests, the plus icon (**+**) will display at the top of the sidebar. Click on the plus icon (**+**). Select an existing collection, or create a new collection, to save the requests to a collection.

### Delete requests

If you want to get rid of all the requests in the history, select **Clear all** link at the top of the sidebar.

To delete a single request, hover over it and click the trash icon that displays next to it.

You can also multi-select and delete requests that you don't want to see in your history by clicking the trash icon that will display at the top of the sidebar once the requests are selected.
