 You can upgrade to a monthly or annual subscription if you would like to leverage full power of Postman.

Select the number of users in your team to use Postman. This number cannot be less than the number of users in your trial team. If you wish to reduce the size of your team, remove some users from the team by visiting the “View Team” link in the Team dropdown.

Click the **Proceed** button to confirm the details and proceed to payment.
