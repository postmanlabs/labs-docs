After you create a Postman account, you can customize your Postman profile. Your Postman profile gives you a way to share important information about yourself with other Postman users.

Your profile includes:

* A profile picture
* A short bio
* Social media links like your GitHub profile
* Links to any teams you are a part of
* An **About Me** section
* A **Highlights** section with pinned elements
* An **Activity** feed with a chronological list of your public activities
* All the public APIs, collections, and workspaces you've created, across all your teams
