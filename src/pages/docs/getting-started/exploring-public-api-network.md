The Postman Public API Network is the largest network of APIs, workspaces, and collections by developers across the planet. Many of the teams and companies responsible for leading-edge APIs and technologies have public workspaces you can explore. Popular third-party APIs are also published, along with examples you can use as a starting point when writing your own APIs or collections.

To access the Public API Network, visit [postman.com/explore](https://www.postman.com/explore) or select **Explore** in the header.

There are a variety of ways to find APIs, workspaces, teams, and collections:

* **Categories** showcases popular API categories in the Public API Network: [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.postman.com/category/artificial-intelligence), [Communication](https://www.postman.com/category/communication), [Data Analytics](https://www.postman.com/category/data-analytics), [Developer Productivity](https://www.postman.com/category/developer-productivity), [DevOps](https://www.postman.com/category/devops), [Financial Services](https://www.postman.com/category/financial-services), and [Payments](https://www.postman.com/category/payments).
* **In the spotlight** highlights the latest exciting, useful, and noteworthy contributions to the Public API Network, handpicked by the experts at Postman.
* **Trending workspaces, collections, and APIs** shows entities that are the most popular in the Public API Network, based on the number of people viewing or creating forks of them.
* The **Search Postman** box at the top of the page searches all Postman teams, workspaces, collections, and APIs by default, but you can also use the search controls to limit a search to the Public API Network.
* Under **Browse**, you can select to view **Teams**, **Workspaces**, **APIs**, and **Collections**. You can sort results by **Featured**, **Most Viewed**, and **Latest** using the **Sort by** dropdown list.
    * You can also filter Collections, APIs, and Workspaces using the categories listed on their results pages.

To import a collection from a public workspace to your workspace, create a fork of it. See [creating a fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/#creating-a-fork).
