Having a free Postman account enables you to [sync](/docs/getting-started/syncing/) and back up your work so that you can access it from different machines. With a Postman account, you can also [collaborate](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/) with others on your API projects.

Signing up for a Postman account is optional, and you can use the Postman desktop app without an account if you prefer. If you do want to create a Postman account, continue to the [Signing up for a Postman account](#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) section.

> If you need assistance with your Postman account, you can contact the Postman [support team](https://www.postman.com/support/) or check out the Help Center's [account FAQs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000609185-My-Account).

## Signing up for a Postman account

Before you sign up for a Postman account, either download and open the [desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or go to the [web app](https://go.postman.co/home/).

You will see a prompt to sign in or sign up. Select __Create Account__. You can sign up using an email address or using your Google account:

* **Email:** Enter your email and create a username and password. Check the box to agree to the __Terms of Use__, which you can view by selecting the link, and select __Create free account__. Postman will send you an email to confirm your account. Follow the instructions in the email to complete your account setup.
* **Google account:** Select __Sign up with Google__ and follow the instructions.

When you first sign up for a Postman account, you will be prompted to provide some information about yourself, including your name and your role, to help customize the app experience to your needs. Enter your details and select __Continue__.

Your new Postman profile will be visible to collaborators and anyone viewing resources you share or publish.

> You can [update your account and profile settings](#updating-your-account-and-profile-settings) at any time.

### Creating or joining a team

During the sign up process, you have the option to create or join a [team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/):

* **Joining a team.** If you are signing up with your company email and your company has a Postman account with team discovery enabled, you will see [teams you can join](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/#finding-teams-within-your-organization).
* **Creating a team.** To create a team and optionally invite collaborators, select __Create new team__. Enter your team name and URL, then select __Continue__.

## Signing into Postman

When you sign in using the Postman desktop app, the app will open a new screen that directs you to _Sign in via web browser_. Your default browser will automatically open a webpage asking you to sign into Postman. If your browser doesn't open within a few seconds, select the **open your browser** link in Postman.

> You can opt out of the sign in process at any time by going back to Postman and selecting **Skip and take me to Postman Desktop App**.

Sign into Postman in your browser by entering your account credentials or signing in with Google. If you are on a Postman Professional or Enterprise plan, opt to **Sign in with SSO**.

Select **Stay signed in for 30 days** if you want to remain signed in after your current session for 30 days before re-authenticating. If you don't want to remain signed in on the computer you are working on, clear this checkbox. Note that you will be prompted to sign in again after 30 minutes.

After you sign in, you will see a confirmation in your browser and you will be redirected back to the Postman desktop app.

> You must complete the process of signing in within five minutes once you begin the process in the Postman desktop app. If you go beyond this time, you must return to the Postman desktop app and restart the sign in process.
