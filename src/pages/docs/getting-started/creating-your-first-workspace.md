Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/), and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace. You can create more workspaces for your personal use and to collaborate with teammates. To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To create a new workspace:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the upper left. Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace. You can also search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace.
1. Choose the workspace's visibility:
    * A **Personal** workspace is only visible to you.
    * A **Private** workspace is only visible to you and to any team members you invite to join it.
    * A **Team** workspace is visible to everyone on your team.
    * A **Public** workspace is visible to all Postman users.
1. Select **Create Workspace**.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.

You can start collaborating with other people by [inviting](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces) them to join your new workspace.
