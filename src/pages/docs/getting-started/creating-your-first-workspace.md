Postman workspaces enable you to organize and work together on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/), and other Postman elements.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace. You can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work with teammates. To create more workspaces, you need to sign in to your [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To create a new workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the upper left. Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace. You can also search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace.
1. Choose the workspace's visibility:
    * A **Personal** workspace is visible only to you.
    * A **Private** workspace is only visible to you and to any team members you invite to it ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).
    * A **Team** workspace is visible to everyone on your team.
    * A **Public** workspace is visible to all Postman users.
1. Select **Create Workspace**.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.
