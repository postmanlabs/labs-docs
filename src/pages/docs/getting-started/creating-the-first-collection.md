Postman Collections are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

## Creating your first collection

To create a new collection, you can start by creating a new request first:

You can create a new request from the sidebar in Postman. Select __New__ &gt; __HTTP Request__.

Enter a request in the request builder and select **Save** to open the **Save Request** dialog box.

1. Create a new collection by selecting **New Collection**. Enter a collection name, and then select **Create**.

1. Select **Save** to save the request in the new collection.

Congratulations! You can see all your collections under **Collections** in the sidebar, as shown below:
