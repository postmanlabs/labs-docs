PagerDuty is a popular incident management solution that integrates with monitoring stacks for alerting, on-call scheduling, and automatic escalation of critical incidents.

You can configure this service to deliver alerts by text, email, call, or through iOS and Android apps.

You can use this integration to trigger incidents in PagerDuty based on your Postman Monitor results, helping your team investigate and resolve Collection run failures quickly.

## Viewing PagerDuty results
