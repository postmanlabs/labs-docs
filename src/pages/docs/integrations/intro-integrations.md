Postman provides an API development toolchain aimed at integrating with your workflow.

The Postman team develops an open ecosystem in conjunction with industry partners to build integrations that facilitate your API projects.

Integrations allow you to automate sharing data and functionality between Postman and other tools you might be using for your API development.

> If you use GitHub for your repository management and use Postman to develop and test your APIs, you can save your Postman Collections to your GitHub repository with the [Postman to GitHub integration](/docs/integrations/github/).

## Accessing integrations

You can access integrations by navigating to your workspace in the [web dashboard](https://go.postman.co/workspaces), then selecting **Integrations**.
