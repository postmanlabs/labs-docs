BigPanda is an IT systems management platform that aggregates and correlates IT alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It directs all alerts to a single place with different connected services.

Setting up a BigPanda integration requires you to get an API key and configure Postman monitors.

After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your Postman monitors.

## Retrieving the BigPanda API key

1. Log in to your [BigPanda](https://bigpanda.io/) account and select "Integrations" in the header toolbar, then click the **New Integration** button.
