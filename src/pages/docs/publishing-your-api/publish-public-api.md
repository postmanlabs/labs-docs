You can share your documentation for any [collection](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/) or [API](http://localhost:8000/docs/getting-started/introduction/) you publish by adding it to the [Postman public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/).

A public workspace serves as a "place" for the community to create API artifacts and quickly share with others interested in collaborating on the similar ideas. It's like a round table discussion you can have with the API producer and API consumers to work together. Anyone could view your workspaces and then create an account if they would like to interact with the workspace and connect with the producer.

Your public workspace provides access to the documentation for your API collection and instant access for anyone to import the collection directly into Postman. Community members can access your Postman profile via your workspace overview. From your public profile, users can view other collections, documentation, and workspaces you have already shared.

Collections and public workspaces provide documentation, requirements, and guidance for people interested in learning and using your APIs. Your document can outline how to use a single endpoint as well as how to integrate with an API as a whole, helping community members learn API skills and discover available services. You can add summaries and categories to your workspaces to help the community find your public workspace and further understand how to use your APIs.

## Create your public workspace

Check out how to [creat a public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) to start sharing your collections and documentation.

## Setting up your profile

To set up your profile, click __Public Profile Settings__ or navigate to [your settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/). Click __Enable Public Profile__ to allow your profile and workspaces to be published.

You can customize your profile URL and name, add a description people will see alongside your collections, documentation, workpaces, and add links to your social media and website. You can also set a profile photo from your [account settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me).

> Customizing your profile URL will change your username, and that change will be reflected across all of your Postman elements, such as collections and documentation. You will also sign in to Postman with the new username.
