The Run in Postman button <img alt="Run in Postman button" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/run-in-postman-button-icon.jpg" width="100px"/> is a way to share a Postman Collection (and optional environment) with your users. Live Run in Postman buttons automatically stay updated with changes to your collection, providing consumers with its most recent version. You can also attach an environment to your live button to help onboard new users to your API quickly and efficiently.

## User interaction with your button

When a user comes across the Run in Postman button <img alt="Run in Postman button" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/run-in-postman-button-icon.jpg" width="100px"/> they can choose to fork the collection to their workspace, view the collection in the public workspace, or import the collection into Postman. Then, they can begin interacting with your API. The Run in Postman button allows the consumers to fork your collection, which creates a copy of the collection while maintaining a link to the parent.

Run in postman buttons are only available for documentation and embed flows.

> **Security check!** Don't leak sensitive data like access keys in your collection or environment. Read more about [securely using API keys in Postman](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-use-api-keys/).
