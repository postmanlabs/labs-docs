This section describes the steps to migrate your team to Postman v8.

## Migrating to Postman v8

[Postman v8](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-postman-desktop-app/) provides a consistent, improved API development experience. It offers universal search across all of Postman, including Public and Private API Networks, plus you can work on public workspaces directly through the desktop app. With v8, the Postman desktop app and [Postman on the web](https://community.postman.com/t/whats-new-in-postman-for-the-web/18203) are equally empowering—which one you use is a matter of preference for your workflows.

## Upgrading from v7 to v8

### Upgrading to v8 as an individual

Non-team users can move from Postman v7 to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > **Download update**.

<img alt="Settings Update" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/settings-update-v7-to-v8.jpg"/>

It is important to verify your work is synced to make sure no data is lost during the update. Click __Verify Sync__.

<img alt="" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/verify-sync-before-updating-v8.jpg" width="450px"/>

Once your work is synced, you can update to Postman v8. Click __Update to v8__.

<img alt="" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sync-update-confirmed-v8.jpg" width="450px"/>

You will need to restart Postman to install the update. Click __Restart and Install Update__.

<img alt="" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/restart-and-install-update-v8.jpg" width="450px"/>

You can start using Postman v8 and access the new UI and features once the update is completed.

### Upgrading to v8 as a team

It is recommended you upgrade your team to v8 at your earliest convenience, however you must upgrade your team as a whole.

If you are on a team and download Postman v8 while the rest of your team is using an older version of Postman (v7 or below), you will not be able to use Postman v8 until your team migrates as a whole to v8. If you need to downgrade to Postman v7 to continue working with your team in the interim, you can [download the latest v7 app](#downloading-postman-v7-app).


Postman displays a message saying you cannot access features on this version of Postman until the team migrates to Postman v8. Syncing and collaboration will not be affected for users who are on v7 or above.

If you are in a team on Postman v8 and would like to downgrade to Postman v7 to continue working with a team that has not upgraded yet, you can [download the latest v7 app](#downloading-postman-v7-app).

## Upgrading your team from v6 or earlier

Migration is only required if users are on v6 or below. This section describes the following topics:

* [Why migrate?](#why-migrate)
* [How to migrate](#how-to-migrate)

### Why migrate?

If you are a team user on v6 or below, you must migrate to Postman v8 to leverage access to public workspace and [Postman’s v8 features](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-postman-desktop-app/). If you are a team user on v7, there is no migration required while you are moving to v8. If you stay back on the older version of Postman, you will not be able to:

* Use role-based permissions which come with a fine-grained access management of some of Postman’s prominent features.

* Access new features and updates because new feature development will be based on [Postman v8](https://www.postman.com/downloads/release-notes/).

**Note:** Once your team migrates to Postman v7 (or above), the native apps 5.x and 6.x versions and Chrome app 5.x versions will stop syncing and all [collaboration features](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro) will stop working and all members of the team need to update their apps to Postman v7 (or above) to continue collaborating.

### How to migrate?

This section illustrates the possible user flows and guides you through the migration process. To use this feature, the entire team must be on Postman v7 or above.

**Note:** The migration decision is restricted to the team admin. If you are a Postman team member and are not on Postman v8, please contact your admin to migrate to Postman v8.

### Upgrading from v6 as an individual

Non-team users can move from Postman v6 to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > Click **Download update**.

First, you need to update your Postman app from v6 to v7.36.5.

<img alt="Migrate v6 to v7.35.6" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/migrate-v6-to-v7.36.5.jpg"/>

Once the update is complete, you will be on Postman v7.36.5. This is the gateway version to update to v8. See [upgrading to v8](#upgrading-from-v7-to-v8) to update your app to Postman v8.

### Upgrading from v6 as a team

If you are an admin, you can go to the [Postman dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/roles) and migrate to Postman v7.

[![migration to v7](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Migrate2.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Migrate2.png)

Click **Migrate my team to v7** and Postman takes care of the next steps for you and your team.

Once your team has migrated to Postman v7, all users in the team would be notified, via email and banners within the app, that they need to update their app to Postman v7.

## Installing earlier versions of Postman

If you happen to be on Postman v8 or below and would like to downgrade to Postman v7 or below to continue working with a team that has not migrated yet, please download the earlier versions of Postman app from the links below.
