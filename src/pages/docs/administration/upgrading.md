This section describes the steps to migrate your team to the latest version of Postman.

Postman v9 provides a consistent, improved API development experience. The Postman desktop app and [Postman on the web](https://community.postman.com/t/whats-new-in-postman-for-the-web/18203) are equally empowering—which one you use is a matter of preference for your workflows.

## Upgrading to Postman v8

### Upgrading to v8 as an individual

Non-team users can move from Postman v7 to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > **Download update**.

It is important to verify your work is synced to make sure no data is lost during the update. Click __Verify Sync__.

Once your work is synced, you can update to Postman v8. Click __Update to v8__.

You can start using Postman v8 and access the new UI and features once the update is completed.

### Upgrading to v8 as a team

Team members on v7 can upgrade to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > **Download update**. You do not need an approval from an admin to upgrade from v7 to v8.

> If you are on a team and download Postman v8 while the rest of your team is using an older version of Postman v7, you will still be able to use v8—syncing and collaboration will not be affected.

## Installing earlier versions of Postman

If you happen to be on Postman v8 or below and would like to downgrade to Postman v7 or below to continue working with a team that has not migrated yet, please download the earlier versions of Postman app from the links below.
