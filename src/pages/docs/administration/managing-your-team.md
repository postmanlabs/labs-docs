## Member roles

Everyone in your team is a member. Each member has certain roles, which allow them to perform various actions. To learn more, visit [Roles and Permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/).

### Managing roles

An admin can modify the roles of other team members, by navigating to [Team](https://go.postman.co/team) > **Manage Roles**. Click **Admin**, **Billing**, or **Developer** next to the corresponding member to assign and unassign roles, then **Save**.

Each team member must have a minimum of one role assigned to them. Additionally, only team members with a billing role will be able to give other users that designation.

Note that teams may have two support accounts at no additional cost. Support accounts are defined as members with only admin and/or billing roles.

## Invites

Invitations are sent to individuals you opt to add to your Postman team. Only admins are able to send, delete, and resend these. To allow Postman users from your company to request to join your team, [make your team discoverable](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/#making-your-team-discoverable).

### Inviting to a team

In [Team](https://go.postman.co/team), click **Invite Users**. Enter the email address of the individual you'd like to invite, then select **Invite Users** to complete.
