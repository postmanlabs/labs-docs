The **All workspaces** dashboard shows a report with aggregated metrics on all your workspaces. It also has separate reports for team and public workspaces. This section has three reports:

* [All Workspaces](#all-workspaces)
* [Team Workspaces](#team-workspaces)
* [Public Workspaces](#public-workspaces)

## All Workspaces

The **All workspaces** summary report contains the following information:

* **Workspaces created over time** - The total number of workspaces created by your team in the last six months. This might include workspaces that have since been deleted, as long as they were created in the reporting period.
* **Workspaces by type** - The total number of personal, private, public, and team workspaces, and the number of empty workspaces of each type. Empty workspaces are workspaces that don't contain any environments, monitors, mocks, collections, or APIs.
