You can request edit access to a team member's personal or private collection / API. You will need a link to the API or collection, or access to it in Postman. When you submit a request, the owner will receive a notification prompting them to choose whether to grant you the role.

> The Viewer role is available depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing).

2. If you have the Editor role on a collection or API that is shared, a team member who has the Viewer role will be able to request an additional role from you.

> The Viewer role is available depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing).

You will receive an email detailing the request for access.
