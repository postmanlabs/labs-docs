Postman's _version control_ features can help you and your team to collaboratively build an API. You can fork a collection or environment, make updates to the fork, create a pull request, and merge your changes into the parent element.

> Version control for collections and environments is different from API versioning. For information on managing multiple versions of APIs, see [Versioning APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/).

## Forking Postman entities

You can fork collections, environments, and flows from a parent element. Forking enables you to contribute to an element without having Editor access to that element.

Learn more about [forking Postman entities](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/).

## Creating pull requests

Create a pull request when you're ready to merge changes you made in your forked element into the parent element.

Learn more about [creating pull requests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/).

## Reviewing pull requests

You can review a pull request if you're tagged as a reviewer on it. You can view the changes, comment, approve or decline the request, and merge the forked collection or environment into the parent element.

Learn more about [reviewing pull requests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/).

## Watching pull requests

Watch a pull request to receive in-app notifications when a team member modifies a pull request.
