If you’re an author of a Postman collection, you can share the API documentation in a bunch of different ways. One way is to share the collection as a template. Community-contributed templates might teach someone how to use an API, automate a tedious task, or just use public APIs to do something fun. Once you create a template, it’s discoverable within the Postman app. People can browse, download relevant templates, and get a jump-start on learning something new.

**Note:** You may use an API published by an organization to solve a particular use case. In such cases, you can publish it as a template for others to use.

### How to add to Postman Templates

When publishing your collection, you can share it with the API community by selecting the radio button **Add to Postman Templates**. The template name is auto-populated from your collection name, as illustrated in the below screen. Add template summary and description, specify categories, and click **Publish Collection**.
