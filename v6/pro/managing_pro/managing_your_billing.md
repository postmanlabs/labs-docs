In this topic, we discuss how to set the monitoring block count, view your account history, and how to add your payment information.


<h3 id="set">Setting the monitoring block count</h3>

Postman Pro teams can send up to 10,000 monitoring requests for free each month. (Postman Enterprise teams can send upt to 100,000 monitoring requests every month without charge.) 

Beyond these free limits, you can choose to pay-as-you-go for additional requests, or pre-purchase discounted blocks of monitoring requests.

For pay-as-you-go, your team will be  billed at $0.75 for every 1,000 requests above 10,000 per month. 

Pre-purchased blocks of monitoring calls provide a discount, and allow you to set a more predictive billing pattern. Blocks of 50,000 monitoring calls are available for a monthly price of $20.

To set the number of monitoring blocks, click the “Set Monitoring Block Count” CTA in your billing overview or usage pages.

To set the monitoring block count: 

* Click the “Set Monitoring Block Count” in the “Your Current Plan” section in the Billing Overview. 
* Select the number of blocks you want to purchase each month. Each block translates to 50,000 monitoring calls and costs $20 per month. 
* Click the **Proceed** button. Review the details of your purchase and click the **Pay** button. Your default payment method is charged immediately, and every month on this date.

<h3 id="payment">Payment Methods</h3>

When you click the “Payment Methods” link, you can add your credit card information so Postman can automatically bill your invoices.

For security, Postman does not store any credit card data. This data is stored only by Stripe, our payment provider. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified as PCI Service Provider Level 1—the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.

Your card is automatically charged monthly or annually, depending on your billing cycle. Other charges for your account, such as additional monitoring calls, are charged to this card.

After payment, you’ll see a confirmation with the transaction ID. Use this ID for any communication with Postman. 

**REMEMBER**: Your card will automatically be charged monthly/annually depending on your billing cycle. Other charges for your account, such as additional monitoring calls, will also be made to this card.
After payment, you’ll see a confirmation with the transaction ID. Use this ID for any communication with us. If you purchased Pro as an administrator, you can also proceed to set up your team.

Clicking the activation link will take you to the sign up page, from where you can create a new account, or sign in with your existing account, to start setting up your team.
