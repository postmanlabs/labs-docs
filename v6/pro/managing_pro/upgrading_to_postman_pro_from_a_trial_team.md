 You can upgrade to a monthly or annual subscription if you would like to leverage full power of Postman. 

To upgrade to a Postman Pro subscription, go to the [Billing Overview](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) page and click the **Upgrade to Pro** button.

In the Configure your Plan page, select the billing cycle (annual or monthly) for your Pro subscription. Your credit card is billed every month or year.

Select the number of users in your team to use Postman. This number cannot be less than the number of users in your trial team. If you wish to reduce the size of your team, remove some users from the team by visiting the “View Team” link in the Team dropdown.

Click the **Proceed** button to confirm the details and proceed to payment.
