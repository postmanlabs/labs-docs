### Native Apps

Postman's native apps will notify you whenever a major update is available. Other updates are indicated by an indicator that appears on the settings icon. If the indicator is red instead of orange, it indicates a failed update.

 To force a check, head over to the Update section of the Settings window. If an update is available, you can choose to start the download. You will be notified when the download is complete prompting you to restart the Postman app to apply the updates. If you're not ready to update yet, click **Later** to auto update after the next app launch.

### Chrome App

Postman's Chrome app is usually updated automatically. However, we have little visibility into the actual update flow, and Chrome sometimes doesn't update the app for a long time.

The latest version is visible on [![Postman's webstore listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en).

To manually force an update, here's what you need to do:

1. Head to [![chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)](chrome://extensions) in Chrome
2. Enable 'Developer Mode'
3. Click the 'Update extensions now' button
