## Overview

Postman now enables API design directly within Postman, making API creation better and faster. Postman's brand new API feature includes the API tab and API elements, extended schema support, and versioning and version tagging. You will now be able to define and manage different versions of your APIs, collection revisions, and other API elements linked to APIs like Postman Collections, monitors, mocks and etc. You will be able to coordinate API changes easily with the help of API versioning and tagging.

With the API feature in Postman, your schema is now treated as the source of truth which defines every variation of the API. Collections can now be used as individual recipes which use endpoints made available by the API, tailored to specific use cases. When you map your real-world APIs into the new API tab, you will be able to define, develop, test, and observe them directly within Postman.

For example, a test engineer working on test suites connected to an API might be collaborating with a technical writer and a developer. The writer would be focused on API documentation, while the developer is working on mocks and monitors attached to the API. Now, all three - test engineer, tech writer, and developer - can on the same API definition in Postman, rather than having to work within the same Postman collection. The API itself is the collaboration point, and collections tagged to the API can represent different use cases for the API.

* Design and develop APIs in your workspace, keep them consistent and backward-compatible

* Link collections (and their revisions) to specific versions of APIs with version tagging

* Create, edit, and import schemas

* Create and manage multiple API versions

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from common API schema formats

* Share APIs with your teams and members

* Streamline the entire API workflow around the API itself

* Iterate on your API enhancements in a much more dynamic, secure, and organized way
