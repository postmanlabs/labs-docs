You can manage workspaces and the Postman elements associated with a workspace, like [collections](/docs/postman/collections/intro_to_collections/), [environments](/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals/), [mocks](/docs/postman/mock_servers/intro_to_mock_servers/), [monitors](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors/), and more. You can perform such tasks as editing names and descriptions, viewing details, or creating elements for workspaces.

In the Postman app, click the workspace that displays in the header bar.

You can also perform this action in the team workspace view.

[![team workspaces dropdown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/dashboard-team-dropdown.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/dashboard-team-dropdown.png)

## Managing workspace elements

When you click a personal or team workspace, you can see all the elements and activity belonging to the workspace.  

If you click the **Share** button, you can share this collection with another workspace. You can share the collection with as many workspaces as you'd like.

If you click the ellipsis **(...)**, you can remove any element from the workspace, publish collections, fork a copy and even merge your changes.

### Collections

[Add an existing collection to this workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces/) or [create a new collection](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections/). You can share a collection to multiple workspaces.

### Environments

Add an existing environment to this workspace or [create a new environment](/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/). You can share an environment to multiple workspaces.

### Monitors

[Create a monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor/) to track the performance of your APIs in a workspace. A monitor created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create a monitor with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new monitor must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Mocks

[Create a mock server](/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock/) to simulate a server response. A mock created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create a mock with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new mock must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Integrations

View a list of current integrations or create a new one. Postman has [third party integrations](/docs/postman_pro/integrations/intro_integrations/) available to help you integrate with your existing workflow and tools. Integrations created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create an integration with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new integration must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Activity

View a [list of activities](/docs/postman/workspaces/activity_feed_and_restoring_collections/) for this workspace.
