When you create a new Workspace, you must determine whether it is a personal or team workspace.

Postman account users can create an unlimited number of personal workspaces. Users who don't have a Postman account can have only one personal workspace. Postman Pro and Enterprise teams have one default team workspace and can create an unlimited number of workspaces.

### How to create a new workspace

Click any workspace that displays in the header bar. For example, in the image below, you'd click "My Workspace". Click "Personal" or "Team" and then click "Create New".

**Personal**

If you select "Personal", enter the name and description of the workspace. If you decide instead to create a team workspace, select "Team" in the Type menu. Click the **Create Workspace** button to see or add existing collections, or [create a collection](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections){:target="_blank"}.

**Team**

If you select "Team", enter the name and description. If you decide instead to create a personal workspace, select "Personal" in the Type menu. Add the email addresses  or usernames of existing users you want to invite to this team workspace; if you are an Admin any email addresses not associated with current team members will be invited to join the team. Click the **Create Workspace** button to see or add existing collections, or [create a collection](/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections){:target="_blank"}.
