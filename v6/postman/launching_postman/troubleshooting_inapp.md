Postman keeps a tab on your activities inside the app and captures log messages automatically to help you debug unresolved issues just in case something goes wrong in the app. You can easily access the stored messages with a few mouse clicks. To access the log messages in macOS, point your cursor to *View* menu, navigate to *Developer* and then select *View Logs in Finder*, as illustrated below:

To access in Linux OS, point your cursor to *View* menu, navigate to *Developer* and then select *View Logs in File Manager*

To access in Windows, point your cursor to *View* menu, navigate to *Developer* and then select *View Logs in File Explorer*

These logs provide you basic information about your activities in the app flow. You can send these log messages to Postman Customer Support to troubleshoot issues when encountered.
