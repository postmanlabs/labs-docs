### Why sign up for a Postman account

When you sign up for a free Postman account, you can:

   *   [Sync](/docs/postman/launching_postman/syncing){:target="_blank"} and back up your history, collections, environments, and header presets.
   *   Easily work on multiple Postman instances from different machines.
   *   Create [collection links](/docs/postman/collections/sharing_collections){:target="_blank"} to send to other developers.

Signing up is completely optional. Read our [EULA](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/postman_base_app){:target="_blank"}, [security page](https://www.getpostman.com/security){:target="_blank"}, and [privacy page](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/privacy){:target="_blank"} to know more.

### Switching multiple accounts

You can sign in to multiple accounts at the same time in the Postman app and the Postman web dashboard. After you sign in, you can switch between these accounts. 

#### How to switch accounts in the Postman app 

When you first open the Postman app, you can sign in as an existing user or create an account. 
If you bypass the initial sign-in option, you can click the **Sign In** button on the top right corner of your screen at any time.
