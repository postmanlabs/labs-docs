*Note: Only an admin of your Okta organization can create the application.*

You can easily set up your custom SAML application in Okta. Postman provides you two ways to accomplish this. One of the ways you can easily configure is by using the readily-available Postman app in Okta to set up your custom SAML application instantly. Other way is to set up your custom SAML application without the Postman app in Okta.

This section describes the following two topics:

* [Setting up a custom SAML application in Okta](#Setting-up-a-custom-SAML-application-in-Okta)

* [Configuring Postman app to set up custom SAML in Okta](#Configuring-Postman-app-to-set-up-custom-SAML-in-Okta)

### Setting up a custom SAML application in Okta

To set up custom SAML application, follow the procedure outlined below: 

After you login to your Okta account, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Admin** as illustrated in the following screen:

2.  From the Okta Dashboard, click **Add Application**.

5.   Under the first step "General Settings", enter an application name and       then click **Next**.

6. Under the second step “Configure SAML”, section A “SAML Settings”,           enter the Postman service provider details which can be found on the         Postman [Edit Team Details](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) page. To go to **Edit Team Details** page, navigate to *Authentication -> <My_Okta_Integration_Name>* and click **Edit**. Next, click **Proceed**. Ensure, you are in the following screen after the completion of this step:

    Now, download the encryption certificate by clicking **Download as file** link (shown in red circle). You will upload this later in the **Okta SAML** configuration section, which is explained below. In the following screen, click **Show Advanced Settings** link to configure advanced SAML assertion settings.

     For the Encryption Certificate, upload the encryption file in the **Encryption Certificate** field shown above (remember, you downloaded the encryption file by clicking **Download as a file** link in Postman's Service Provider Details section earlier). Click **Next** to continue.

8.  Under the third step “Feedback”, select “I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app”, and check “This is an internal app that we have created”, and then click **Finish**.

     Once you fill-in the details, click the **Generate relay/Regenerate relay** button to create a parameter to send with a SAML response in an IDP-initiated single sign-on. Copy the **relay state** and paste it in the following screen:
