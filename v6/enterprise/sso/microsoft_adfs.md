Postman supports single sign-on (SSO) logins through SAML 2.0 for Enterprise users.

### Prerequisites

* An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.

* A server running Microsoft Server 2012 or 2008. This guide uses screenshots from Server 2012R2,
but similar steps should be possible on other versions.

* A SSL certificate obtained from the AD FS server.

After you meet these basic requirements, install AD FS on your server. 

To configure and install AD FS, see [Deploy and configure AD FS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg188612.aspx) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

### Configuration

**Step 1** - Create an AD FS authentication scheme in Postman.

This is explained in SSO for admins article. After creating the scheme, collect the values for these fields from Postman Edit Team Details page.

| Fields  |   AD FS equivalent  |  |
| ---   |   ---     | ---   |
| Assertion Consumer Service URL   |  SAML 2.0 SSO service URL    | |
| Encryption Certificate   |   Token encryption certificate    | |

**Step 2** - Add a Relying Party Trust.

A Relying Party Trust (RPT) is used to define the connection between AD FS and Postman.

Select the Relying Party Trusts folder from AD FS Management.

On the Actions sidebar, click "Add Relying Party Trust" to start the configuration wizard for a new trust. 

Select the **Claims aware radio** button in the Welcome screen and click the **Start** button.

On the next screen, upload the encryption certificate which you can collect from Postman Edit Team Details page or leave the certificate settings at their defaults.

IMAGE

On the next screen, check the box labeled Enable Support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol. 
The service URL (ACS URL) can be collected from Postman Edit Team Details page.

On the next screen, add a Relying party trust identifier of https://identity.getpostman.com.

IMAGE

On the next screen, select Permit everyone.

On the next two screens, the wizard will display an overview of your settings. 
On the final screen use the Close button to exit and open the Claim Rules editor.

Step 3 - Creating claim rules

Once the relying party trust has been created, you can create the claim rules.

To create a new rule, click on Add Rule. Create a Send LDAP Attributes as Claims rule.

IMAGE

On the next screen, using Active Directory as your attribute store, do the following: 
    1. From the LDAP Attribute column, select E-Mail Addresses.
    2. From the Outgoing Claim Type, select E-Mail Address.

Click on Finish to save the new rule.

Create another new rule by clicking Add Rule, this time selecting Transform an Incoming Claim as the template.

IMAGE

On the next screen:
    1. Select E-mail Address as the Incoming Claim Type.
    2. For Outgoing Claim Type, select Name ID. 
    3. For Outgoing Name ID Format, select Email. 
Leave the rule to the default of Pass through all claim values.

IMAGE

Finally, click on Finish button to create the claim rule.
There should be 2 transform rules. You can check this by clicking on Edit Claim Issuance Policy.

Step 4 - Adjusting the trust settings
You still need to adjust a few settings on your relying party trust. To access these settings, select Properties 

from the Actions sidebar while you have the RPT selected.

In the Advanced tab, make sure SHA-1 is specified as the secure hash algorithm.

Step 5 - Submit identity Provider details to Postman
Once this setup is done, you need to submit your Identity Provider's details to Postman.

Download the FederationMetadata.xml. It is generally located at https://<Federation Service name>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml

Collect the Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL, Identity Provider Issuer and X.509 Certificate 

from metadata file and fill these values in your Postman Edit Team Details page (in the AD FS Identity Provider Details dialog).
