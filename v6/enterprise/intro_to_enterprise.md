Postman helps Enterprise users build an API development workflow that monitors the health and status of APIs, produces quality documentation, connects to third party tools for API development, and implements an agile process to test APIs.

Postman provides Enterprise users with:

* Single Sign-On (SSO): Access to the company’s Postman instance based on the customer’s existing identity management flow. Postman Enterprise currently supports multiple SSO providers – Okta, OneLogin, Duo, Ping Identity, AD FS, and GSuite. Postman provides SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider support. 

* Audit logs: Ability to track activities within teams, particularly when collaborating on code. Postman Enterprise users can use audit logs to review every change, see who made it, and when it was made. 

* Extended support and billing: Dedicated support, onboarding and billing options for larger organizations, and provisioning.

In addition to SSO, audit logs, and extended support and billing, the Enterprise plan shares Postman Pro features, such as:

* [Dedicated IP addresses](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors#monitoring-resources-in-multiple-regions){:target="_blank"} for API monitoring.

* Team [collaboration](/docs/v6/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} for the single source of truth about your API.  

* API [documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation){:target="_blank"} to share public or private documentation in a web page.

* [Mock servers](/docs/postman/mock_servers){:target="_blank"} to simulate the real API and decouple teams collection [monitoring](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors) to check the performance of your API.

* [Out-of-the-box integrations](/docs/pro/integrations/intro_integrations){:target="_blank"} and the [Postman API](/docs/pro/pro_api/intro_api){:target="_blank"} to connect your different tools.
