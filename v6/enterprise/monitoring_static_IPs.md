Static IPs are fixed IP addresses. Services with assigned static IP addresses use the same IP address to connect to the Internet. Companies often use fixed IP addresses to more easily connect to services over the Internet, or redirect domain names to their servers. 

By default, Postman Monitors access APIs from dynamic IP addresses. For Enterprise users who want to test APIs behind a whitelist restricted firewall, Postman provides the option to monitor APIs from a static IP address. 

By whitelisting a single static IP address, customers can monitor their APIs using Postman’s monitoring service, while conforming to company security policies. 

You can create a new monitor or change an existing monitor to run from a static IP address.

#### Changing an existing monitor to run from a static IP address

In the Postman app, click the "Build" dropdown menu and select "Browse".<br/> <br/>

At the top of the page, select "Monitors". 

Choose the monitor and click the **Edit** button.
