### Upgrade your plan

To upgrade your plan to a Postman Enterprise subscription, you will need a [Postman account](/docs/postman/launching_postman/postman_account/). 

Log in to your Postman account, and go to the [billing page](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview). Next to your current plan, click the **Upgrade** button. For existing Postman Pro users, click the ellipsis *(...)* next to the **Upgrade** button and select the "Change plan" option.
