Postman's [native apps](http://www.getpostman.com/apps) (for Mac and Windows) run on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), 
and overcome a number of restrictions of the Chrome platform.

A few features exclusive to the native apps are listed here:

1. [Cookies](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/cookies)<br>The native apps let you work with cookies directly. Unlike the Chrome app, no separate extension is needed.<br>

2. [Built-in proxy](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/capture_mac)<br>The native apps come with a built-in proxy that you can use to capture network traffic. 


3. Menu bar<br>The Chrome app had a very limited menu bar. With the native apps you can create collections, switch to History requests, and more!<br>

5. Restricted headers<br>
The latest versions of the native apps let you send headers like Origin and User-Agent. These are restricted in the Chrome app. For more info on the new Postman Runtime, check [our blog post](http://blog.getpostman.com/2016/06/14/introducing-postman-runtime-more-power-better-control/).
