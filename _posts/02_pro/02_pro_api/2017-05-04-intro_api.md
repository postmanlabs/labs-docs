The [Postman Pro API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) has several endpoints to help you integrate Postman even more deeply with your development toolchain. You can add new collections, update existing collections, update environments, add and run monitors directly through the API. This API allows you to programmatically access data stored in your Postman Pro account with ease.

The easiest way to get started with the API is to click the **Run in Postman** button at the top of the [Postman Pro API documentation page](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) and use the Postman app to send requests.

### Postman Pro API overview

1.  You need a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints. Postman Pro users can get a key from the [integrations dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations).

2.  API has an access rate limit applied to it.

3.  Using the API, you can add and update collections, environments, and users. Run monitors, create a mock server, and so much more.
4.  Review more [documentation for the Postman Pro API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/).

### Authentication

An API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman Pro API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.

> **If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations).**

An API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access in Postman Pro is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.

For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an environment variable called ``postman_api_key`` and this collection will automatically use it to make API calls.

### Rate Limits

API access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.

| Header                | Description   |
| ---                   | ---           |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`   | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`| The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`   | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |
