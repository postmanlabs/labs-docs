Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, bringing together data from servers, databases, tools, and services to present a unified view of an entire stack. 

This integration allows you to configure your Postman Monitors to send metrics to Datadog where you can visualize and compare with other metrics.

Setting up a Datadog integration requires you to get an API key and configure Postman monitors. After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your Postman Monitors.

### Retrieving your Datadog API Key

Log in to Datadog, and select [Integrations page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api){:target="_blank"} in the header toolbar. An `API Key` will be created for you automatically under the `APIs` tab. If you want, you can also create one by specifying a name for it. Make a note of the API Key for later.

### Configuring Postman Monitors

1. In the [Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations) page, select Datadog from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

3. To send you monitor metrics and events to Datadog:
* Select the monitor to send to Datadog.
* Enter a Datadog provided API key or generate an API key.
* Optionally indicate if you want to send events for completed runs or send metrics for each run.

4. Click the **Add Integration** button.


### Viewing data in Datadog

As soon as your monitor runs, the data will start flowing into Datadog.

Once the data is present in Datadog, you can filter it based on the monitor name/uid, collection name/uid, user name/id, and even environment name/uid (if present). You can combine different metrics to create a dashboard.
