### Backup your Postman Collections to your Github repositories

Backup and synchronize your Postman Collections on GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world. Your Collections are all tucked in safe and sound with our latest Postman Pro to GitHub Integration.

### Add the GitHub Integration

In the **[Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations)** page, select Github from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

Click the View Details button to see information about Github and how it can provide real-time alerting based on the results of your Postman monitors. 

You also can click the Configured Integrations tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for Keen IO, or view all integrations.

Click the Add Integration button to display the page that lets you authorize a backup of your Postman collections.

In the Authorization page:

* Select a collection to back up.
* Select the repository.
* Enter the directory where the collection will be pushed.
* Enter the file name of the collection in the repository.
* Enter the branch where the collection will be pushed.


Click the **Add Integration** button. Now every change saved to your Postman Collection will automatically commit changes to your GitHub repo in real time.  Your Collections and code can live together in perfect harmony in the same repository.
