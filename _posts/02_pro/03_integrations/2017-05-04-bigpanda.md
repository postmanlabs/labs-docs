BigPanda is an IT systems management platform that aggregates and correlates IT alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It directs all alerts to a single place with different connected services

Setting up a BigPanda integration requires you to get an API key and configure Postman monitors. 

After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your Postman monitors.


### Retrieving the BigPanda API key

1. Log in to your [BigPanda](https://bigpanda.io/){:target="_blank"} account and select "Integrations" in the header toolbar.

### Viewing alerts in BigPanda

BigPanda gives you real-time alerting based on the results of your Postman Monitors. If there was a failed test or if an error occurred during the run, an alert would be created on BigPanda, which would then alert the user.
