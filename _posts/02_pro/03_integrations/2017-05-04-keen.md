### Push Monitor results into Keen Streams for API-based computation & S3 backups

Keen IO can be used for API-based computation, Amazon S3 backups, and building visualizations and dashboards for your APIs.  Connect your Postman Monitor results to Keen Streams with the Postman Pro to Keen Integration.

Retrieve your Keen IO project ID and API Key

[Log in](https://keen.io/home/) to Keen IO.  Find the Organization and Project you’d like to stream Postman Monitor data to.  Go to your Project’s Settings and select API Keys.  Make a note of your Project ID and API key for later.

### How your data appears in Keen IO

Within a few minutes, you should start to see data flowing into Keen IO provided your Monitor is running.  If you’ve sent the results of multiple Postman Monitors to Keen, you’ll be able to segment by monitor name/id, collection name/id, error code, etc. 

Here’s a preview of analyses from the Postman Monitors integration. You can build visualizations into dashboards that your team or customers can view, by utilizing [Keen dashboard templates](https://keen.io/docs/visualize/how-to-create-a-dashboard/).
