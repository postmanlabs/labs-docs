You can use the Postman Pro to APIMatic Integration to back up your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint and other API Description formats. APIMatic Integration converts your Postman Collections to any major API description format and save them to GitHub.  API Transformer uses a GitHub repository to save its documentation.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.




In the **Integrations** page, select APIMatic from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

Click the **View Details** button to see information about APImatic and how the Postman to APIMatic integration converts, formats, and saves your Postman collections to Github. 

You also can click the **Configured Integrations** tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for Keen IO, or view all integrations.
