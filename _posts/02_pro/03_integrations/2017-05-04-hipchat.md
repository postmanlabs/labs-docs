HipChat is an instant messaging app built for businesses. The team chat tool lets you share files and discuss tasks in real-time with colleagues, project collaborators and even clients through unlimited chatrooms. This integration allows you to get real-time updates of what is happening in your Postman team.

Currently, there are four ways in which you configure HipChat with Postman.

### Monitor Run Results

You can set up monitors on your collections which run on the cloud at a scheduled interval. This integration allows you to get notifications about your monitor runs right into HipChat.

### Team Activity Feed

The Team Activity Feed is the place where you can view all the things taking place in your team. You can monitor the API development within your team and keep track of all the changes. This integration keeps you updated of all the changes in HipChat itself, so you don't have to go back to Postman to see the team activity feed.

### Get the HipChat Webhook URL

Log in to HipChat and head over to the room where you want Postman to send you messages. Click on the `Add Integration` button on the right sidebar.

Select the `Build Your Own Integration` option.

Give it a name of your choice and click on `Create`.

This will generate a URL where messages will be posted by Postman. Make a note of this URL to use it later. Click on `Save` to save the integration.

### Updates on HipChat

Monitor run results on HipChat are color-coded based on the result of the monitor run. It shows the basic metrics of the run and also provides a link to go directly to the monitor.

Similarly, the team activity feed integration consists of the links of the changed instance.
