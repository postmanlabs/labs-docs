Review [reference for using Markdown](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33232/markdown-in-api-documentation/JsGc) in API documentation. Postman has created a collection intended to test Markdown styling inside Postman or within other services that render Markdown. The descriptions in the collection contain Markdown syntax and some of them have links to HTML pages of their rendered version.

Postman supports Markdown as a way to style text descriptions for requests, collections, and folders within collections. You can even embed screenshots and other images for more descriptive flair.
