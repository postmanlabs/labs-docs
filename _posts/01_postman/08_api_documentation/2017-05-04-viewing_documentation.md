Each collection has a private and public documentation view, generated in real-time using the data synced to our servers. 

### Viewing Private Documentation

Private documentation is only accessible to you and your Postman Pro or Enterprise teammates. To see private documentation, click the **View in web** button in the Postman app or in the [Postman web view](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/collections/team){:target="_blank"}. 

To view private documentation for a collection, you must be signed in to the Postman app. When signed in, your username displays in the top-right corner.

In the Postman app, expand the right angle bracket (**>**) next to any collection name to open the collections details view, and then click the **View in web** button.

To view documentation for your team’s collections in the Postman app, click the **View in Web** button in your [Team Library](/docs/postman/team_library/sharing). Then select the "Team Collections" view. You’ll be able to browse all folders and requests in the collection, and see how the requests and code snippets look with different environments selected.

This link will not work for anyone who does not have access to the collection itself. If it's a private collection, viewership will be restricted to you alone. If it's a shared collection, your Pro or Enterprise teammates will be able to view it as well.

To make this documentation available to other users, perhaps as a link on your website, you’ll need to [publish the documentation](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/collections/team){:target="_blank"}.

### Viewing Public Documentation

The public view is accessible through the public link that is generated when you publish your documentation. When you've published your documentation, anyone can access it via the public URL. This public URL will be displayed right after your documentation is published, and is also accessible via the **Published** dropdown in the private documentation view.

Public documentation can be viewed through the link that is generated when you publish your documentation. This public URL will appear after you click Publish Collection, but it is also accessible in your private documentation view by selecting Published in the dropdown menu.

If you choose a verified custom domain, then your public documentation will also be available from your custom domain. For more information about using a custom domain, read about [adding and verifying custom domains](/docs/postman/api_documentation/adding_and_verifying_custom_domains).
