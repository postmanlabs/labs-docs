Once you set up monitors, you can receive daily and weekly emails with a summary for all your monitors. These email notifications can be turned off in the settings. In addition, you will receive important notifications (both [in-app](/docs/postman/notifications) and email) in case a monitor fails.

You can also view more detailed results from your dashboard.

### Monitors page

Sign in to the Postman web view, and head over to the [monitors page](https://monitor.getpostman.com/){:target="_blank"} which lists out all your monitors (both team and private). Select a timeframe for which you want to view the results of the monitor runs.

You can view various stats for each of the monitors.

| **Status** | Number of failed runs in the selected timeframe. A ‘Healthy’ status indicates that there were no failures in any of the runs. |
| **Average success rate** | The percent of successful runs out of the total runs in the timeframe. A run is said to be successful only when all the tests passed during that run. You can also see a change in this value compared to the previous time period. |
| **Average response time** | The average response time of all the requests over all the runs in milliseconds. You can also see the percentage change from the previous time period. |


Click on any of the monitors to view more details about its performance and troubleshooting in case of any failures.

### Monitor details page

The main timeline shows all past runs of the monitor. Each bar signifies one run of the monitor - with red indicating failing tests. The graph in blue shows the total response time (of all the requests) over time. This is a great way of measuring performance improvements when you’ve made changes to your infrastructure.

You can click on any of the runs from this graph to see its results in more details.

The results section shows request-level details: test results, response code, response time, and the response size. Additionally, you can filter by region if you set up [monitors in multiple regions](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors#monitoring-resources-in-multiple-regions).

You can also view the log by clicking on the **Console Log** tab.

The console log will print a detailed log of run events, along with any console.log statements that ran as part of your pre-request and test scripts and can be used to [diagnose failures](/docs/postman/monitors/troubleshooting_monitors).
