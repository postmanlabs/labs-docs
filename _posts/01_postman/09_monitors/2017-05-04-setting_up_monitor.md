Postman lets you monitor shared or private collections. If you choose to monitor a shared collection, your team can see the monitor. However, if you create a monitor on an unshared collection, the monitor will be private and only visible to you.


You can create a monitor from the:
* Sidebar menu
* **New** button
* Launch screen
* Postman web 
 
### Sidebar menu

You can create a monitor for an existing collection from the sidebar.
1. In the Postman app, click on the ellipses (…) next to the collection you want to monitor.

2. Select "Monitor Collection" to open the **MONITOR COLLECTION** modal.
3. Enter a name for this monitor and choose a corresponding environment. 
4. Add an appropriate [schedule for the monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#monitoring-schedule), and configure [additional preferences](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#additional-preferences).
5. Click the **Monitor this collection** button.

 * Create a new API
   
   Select a request method and enter the request URL, status code, and response time. Then click the **Next** button.
    
    
    
    * Enter the monitor name, indicate how often you want the monitor to run, select the region(s) to monitor, and then click the **Create** button.
     
     The **Next Steps** x appears with information about the monitor and provides suggestions about next steps.
     
   * My Collections
   
     * Select a collection.
     * Select an environment, indicate whether you want the mock server to be private, and then click the **Create** button.

You receive notifications when either the response code doesn’t match or the response time falls below the expected values. You can also add method, headers, and body to the individual URLs in the request builder, as well as add custom test scripts.

### Monitoring schedule and region

Select a frequency to run your monitor. Monitors can run as frequently as every 5 minutes. For example, you can run a monitor every 5 minutes or every Monday at 9:00 AM. 

When you specify a monitor to run in multiple regions, the monitor will run multiple times. This means that if there is a side effect from running the monitor, it will also happen multiple times.
