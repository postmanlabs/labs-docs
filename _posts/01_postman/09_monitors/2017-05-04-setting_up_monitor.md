If you choose to monitor a shared collection, your team can see the monitor. However, if you create a monitor on an unshared collection, the monitor will be private and only visible to you.

### From the Postman app

Click on the ellipses (**...**) next to the collection you wish to monitor. Select "Monitor Collection" to open the **MONITOR COLLECTION** modal.

Enter a name for this monitor and choose a corresponding environment. Add an appropriate [schedule for the monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#monitoring-schedule), and configure [additional preferences](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#additional-preferences).

### From the Postman web

Sign in to the Postman web view, and head over to the [monitors page](https://monitor.getpostman.com/){:target="_blank"}. Click the **Add Monitor** button.

[![add monitor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/681190/21090390/792944e2-c065-11e6-8937-39c18fe888ad.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/681190/21090390/792944e2-c065-11e6-8937-39c18fe888ad.png)

Enter a name for this monitor. Choose the collection that you want to monitor and a corresponding environment. Add an appropriate [schedule for the monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#monitoring-schedule), and configure [additional preferences](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor#additional-preferences).

### Monitoring schedule and region

Select a frequency to run your monitor. Monitors can run as frequently as every 5 minutes. For example, you can run a monitor every 5 minutes or every Monday at 9:00 AM.

To [monitor resources in multiple regions](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors#monitoring-resources-in-multiple-regions), select the regions to run your monitor from the [monitors page](https://monitor.getpostman.com){:target="_blank"}. When you specify a monitor to run in multiple regions, the monitor will run multiple times. This means that if there is a side effect from running the monitor, it will also happen multiple times.
