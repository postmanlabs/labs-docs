Throughout the development process, delays on the front- or back-end impedes dependent teams from completing their work efficiently.  

Using Postman's mock servers, front-end developers can simulate each endpoint in a Postman Collection (and corresponding environment) to view the potential responses, without actually spinning up a back end.

Now front-end, back-end, and API teams can now work in parallel, freeing up developers who were previously delayed as a result of these dependencies.

### Setting up the mock

Developers can mock a request and response in Postman before they send the actual request or set up a single endpoint to return the response. 

An [example](/docs/postman/collections/examples) in the earliest phase of API development requires clear communication, which is instrumental in aligning expectations among team members. When communication is clear and expectations are aligned, developers and testers can start more quickly.

You can create a mock in several ways: 

  1. [Using the Postman app](/docs/postman/mock_servers/mocking_with_examples){:target="_blank"}
  2. [Using the Postman Pro API](/docs/postman/mock_servers/mock_with_api){:target="_blank"}
  3. Using the **New** button.
  4. Using the launch modal. 
  
Once you've created the mock, Postman Pro and Enterprise users can share the mock with their team for review and collaboration. This is accomplished by [sharing the underlying collection](/docs/postman/team_library/sharing#sharing-collections){:target="_blank"} with the team or specific team members, providing permissions to edit or view.


#### Creating a mock with the New button

1.  In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.

[![new button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/HeaderToolBar.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/HeaderToolBar.png)

The "Create New" modal appears.
[![create screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/create_new_screen.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/create_new_screen.png)

**Note**: At the bottom of the modal you can select "Show this window at launch" to indicate whether you want the "Create New" modal to display each time you open Postman.

2. Click "Mock Server".

3. In the "Create API Documentation" screen, you can create documentation for a "New API", "My Collections", and "Team Library". 
   * New API
     
     * Enter a request path, status code, response code and click the **Next** button.
     * Enter the mock server name, indicate if you want the mock server to be private, and click the **Create** button.
     
    The Next Steps screen appears with information about the mock server and provides suggestions about next steps.
    
   * My Collections
   
     * Select a collection.
     * Select an environment, indicate if you want the mock server to be private, and click the **Create** button.
     
     The "Next Steps" screen appears with information about the mock server and provides suggestions about next steps.
     
   * Team Library
   
     * Select a shared collection.
     * Select an environment, and click the **Create** button.
     
     The "Next Steps" screen appears with information about the mock server and provides suggestions about next steps.
     
#### Creating a mock using the launch screen

The "Create New" modal appears by default when you launch Postman. At the bottom of the screen you can select "Show this window at launch" to indicate whether you want the "Create New" modal to display each time you open Postman.

1. Open Postman.
2. In the "Create New" modal, click "Mock Server".
3. Follow step 3 in previous **New** button section. 

### HTTP access control (CORS)

Not only can you make requests to mock endpoints using the Postman app, you can also rely on a mock using a browser.

A web browser makes a cross-origin HTTP request when requesting a resource from a domain, protocol, or port that's different from its own. 

For security reasons, [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS){:target="_blank"} is a standard that defines a way in which a browser and server can interact securely. In this case, we are referring to how a web browser interacts with the mock endpoints hosted on the Postman server.

CORS is enabled for Postman mock servers which means you can stub your web apps with mocked data using the mock endpoints. In other words, development or production web apps can make requests to the Postman mock endpoint you just created and receive an example response.

### Free mock server calls with your Postman account

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free mock server calls per month. 

You can check your usage limits in the [Postman Pro API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com){:target="_blank"} or in the [account usage page](https://go.pstmn.io/postman-account-limits){:target="_blank"}.
