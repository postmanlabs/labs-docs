### Why sign up for a Postman account

When you sign up for a free Postman account, you can:

   *   [Sync](/docs/postman/launching_postman/syncing) and back up your history, collections, environments, and header presets.
   *   Easily work on multiple Postman instances from different machines.
   *   Create [collection links](/docs/postman/collections/sharing_collections) to send to other developers.

Signing up is completely optional. Read our [EULA](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/postman_base_app){:target="_blank"}, [security page](https://www.getpostman.com/security){:target="_blank"}, and [privacy page](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/privacy){:target="_blank"} to know more.
