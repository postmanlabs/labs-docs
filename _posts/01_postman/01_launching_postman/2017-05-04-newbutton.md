## BUILDING BLOCKS
### Creating requests
You can create any kind of [HTTP request.](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/requests){:target="_blank"}

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
2. In the **Create New** tab, click "Request".
3. Select a collection and save the request in it. 

You can either create a new collection or select an existing one. After you save the request, you can add the URL, method, headers, and body to the request in the builder.

### Creating collections
A collection is a group of individual requests that you can organize into folders. 

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
2. In the **Create New** tab, click "Collection".
3. In the **CREATE A NEW COLLECTION** modal:
* Enter a name and optional description.
* Select an authorization type.
* Enter a pre-request script to execute before the collection runs.
* Add a test to execute after the collection runs.
* Add variables to the collection and its requests.
4. Click the **Create** button.

After creating the collection, you can save requests to the collection and add folders for better organization.

### Creating mock servers
A [mock server  ](/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock){:target="_blank"} simulates each endpoint in a Postman Collection. You can mock a request and response in Postman before you send the actual request or set up a single endpoint to return the response. 

1. In the header toolbar, click the **New** button.
2. In the **Create New** tab, click “Mock Server”.
3. Select if you want to mock a new API or an existing or team collection. If you create a new API to mock, you must select a request method and enter the request path, response code, and response body. If you use an existing or team collection to mock, you must select a collection from a list of existing or team collections. 

[![config mock](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/mock-config.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/mock-config.png)

## Template and API Network tabs

### Templates tab

You can select ‘Templates’ to help you: check links, track Github issues, verify non-MFA access to AWS accounts, monitor the status of URLs, check DNS records, use Postman Echo to test your REST client and make sample API calls, and monitor AWS ElasticBeanstalk environments. 

You can view all the templates, or select to view them in the "Developer" or "DevOps" category.

[![templates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/templates-tab.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/templates-tab.png)

To import a template:

1. Click on the template you want. In this example we're using the "Link Checker" template.

**Note**: Each template has a description that lists the values required to run the template. In this example, the Link Checker template requires a `start_url` and a `root_url`.

[![linkCheckertemplates](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/linkchecker-template.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/linkchecker-template.png)

<ol start="2">
  <li>Click the <b>Use this template</b> button to summon the <b>Customization options</b> screen.</li>
</ol>

This screen lists what Postman will create for you with this template and some configuration options available to you. Postman saves the values you enter as environment variables. Make sure you fill all the fields as these values might be crucial for the template to work properly.

<ol start="3">
  <li>To configure your monitor, select how often you want the monitor to run and enter the URL you want to monitor in "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS" section.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Create</b> button.</li>
</ol>

The **Success!** screen displays what Postman created for you and suggests next steps to consider to get the most out of the template.

<ol start="5">
  <li>Click the <b>Okay</b> button to exit the screen.</li>
</ol>

### API Network tab

The Postman API Network provides the most authentic and actionable directory of public APIs available. Every API listed in this network includes a complete Postman collection, created by the API's publisher. Postman specifically designed the API list to onboard developers quickly and effectively.

On the left side of the screen, Postman groups the APIs categories such as Marketing, Financial Services, E-commerce, and so on. You can search these categories to find an API.

After you select an API from the list, you can import it into your collections.

[![API_network](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork-tab.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/apiNetwork-tab.png)

To import an API in the API Network:

1. Click an API in the API Network list. In this example, we're using the Auth0 API.
